run the command:
npm install @openzeppelin/truffle-upgrades

PD-9:
Upgrade to Solidity 8, SafeMath built-in since this version.

PD-9 Best Practices
Update your smart contract with 3 of the following:
- add a modifier; ✔️ (more information https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/common-patterns.html#restricting-access )
- add a selfdestruct function; ✔️ (Added to Ormr.sol , more information: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/contracts.html#modifiers 
however this won't work with openzeppelin, see https://zpl.in/upgrades/error-003)
- if you use send or transfer, replace it with call;
- add natspec comments ✔️ Guidelines: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/natspec-format.html 
Tool -> https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen/blob/master/README.md#contracts-with-dependendencies
walkthrough:
1: npm install solidity-docgen
2: npm install solc-0.8.0@npm:solc@0.8.0 (you need to use an alias to select compiler version for the next command)
3: npx solidity-docgen --solc-module solc-0.8.0
4: NatSpec comments generated! find them in ./docs)
- add safemath ✔️ (built-in since sol 0.8.0)


PD-9 Verify Source:
Verified the contract my group has to use for the field assignment:
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x75576d08c398157a5053d49f5d6fbb22514ff157#code

steps:
I had to downgrade to sol 0.7.6 (thanks OpenZeppelin)
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts 
change import paths in the contract to point to node_modules
run the following command:
truffle run verify Studieschuld@0x75576d08c398157a5053d49f5d6fbb22514ff157 --network rinkeby

after this succeeded, upgrading back to sol 0.8.0
